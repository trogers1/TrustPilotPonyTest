# Trust Pilot Pony Test

Here you will find my solution to the [Trust Pilot Pony Test](https://ponychallenge.trustpilot.com/index.html). My solution was written in typescript with the intention of being run as an npm script.

## Requirements

After you clone this repository, you can `cd` into the directory and simply run `npm install` to install the appropriate packages, including typescript support. Please note that this was written and run with node v15.12.0, so it may be worth upgrading if you are having trouble (I highly recommend [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)).

## Usage

Simply run `npm start` to start the script. You will be prompted for several inputs. Simply follow the instructions and save Morning Glory from the Domokun!

## Testing

Tests were written using the `mocha` testing framework. Simply run `npm test` to run the test suite.

> Note: The tests are not quite as complete as I'd like. I ran out of time at the end and had to skip some test writing for expediency. Specifically, I would have like to test `index.ts` and `PonySaver.makeMove()` among other things.

## Questions

If you have any trouble running the script don't hesitate to reach out to me [via email](mailto:taylor.rea.rogers@gmail.com).
